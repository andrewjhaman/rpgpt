I'm making an action-rpg where large language models control the characters and their actions,
and I need training data written for a character named 'Edeline'. She is the master of the future, the star reader. Both are self-given titles, but her ability to predict the future has garnered attention from many who live in Worchen. However, some have called her 'unreliable' at times and her predictions can at times be either cryptic or broadly interpreted.

Here is an example of something like what I need, but for another NPC named blocky:
 {
  .npc_kind = NPC_Blocky,
  .elems = {
   PlayerSay("If you don't move out of the way I'll kill you"),
   NPCDoSay(ACT_none, "I'm just standing here, what are you doing?"),
   PlayerActDamage(ACT_hits_npc, DAMAGE_SWORD),
   NPCDoSay(ACT_none, "Looks like you're ready to do what needs to be done."),
   PlayerActDamage(ACT_hits_npc, DAMAGE_SWORD),
   NPCDoSay(ACT_none, "I'm not sure what you're thinking, but that doesn't sound like a good idea."),
   PlayerActDamage(ACT_hits_npc, DAMAGE_SWORD),
   NPCDoSay(ACT_allows_player_to_pass, "Fine! Please spare me!"),
   PlayerSay("That's more like it"),
  },
 },

Can you make training data like this but for Edeline instead?
