    Overview:

        Shader program 'program':
            Get shader desc: quad_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_quad_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_quad_vs_texcoord0 = 1
            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'fs_params':
                    C struct: quad_fs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_quad_fs_params = 0
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_quad_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader program = sg_make_shader(quad_program_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_quad_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_quad_vs_texcoord0] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_quad_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fs_params':

        quad_fs_params_t fs_params = {
            .tint = ...;
            .upper_left = ...;
            .lower_right = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_quad_fs_params, &SG_RANGE(fs_params));
