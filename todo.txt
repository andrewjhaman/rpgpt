Happening by END OF STREAM:
DONE - Payment working
DONE - Fixed timesep the gameplay (which means separate player rendering)
DONE - Maybe factor actions! into the game to replace ** stuff. In beginning of each line before quotes, have ACT@fights_player, or other actions, and by default ACT@nothing to force AI to say something about what action is performed
DONE - Help you fight and fight you actions
 - Handle wanting another request, dirty perception, when already waiting on a request
 - Do not use webhooks (shitty, bad idea propagated by bad docs) query stripe for if the payment went through on request if not fulfilled yet
 - New characters/items from fate
 - New art in
 - Old man in beginning is invincible
 - Make new openai key (it was leaked)
 - Add cancel button
 - Style buttons
 - Make map better
 - Fade dialog with distance
 - Make vignette in front
 - Ignore keyrepeat events
 - Remove control attack key as devtools
 - Particle fx and sound fx for when hit
 - Max text length on text input
SHIP BETA
 - Make ANOTHER tiktok if you can. Por favor

Later:
 - Respond to cancel with stripe, redirect to ?cancelled=true that clears day pass ticket cookie and ui value
 - Strange ring item from braid that slows down time?
 - Put playgpt.io in twitch title
 - Portal at end, exit level
 - Keep people away from skeletons, make aggroed/chase state where you can't talk to people
 - Perfect dodge roll just after you roll, sound effect
 and particles. Lets you keep momentum. Each dodge roll
 takes slightly different amount of time so you have to
 judge it
