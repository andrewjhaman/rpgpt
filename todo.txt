DONE - make npcs resiliant to player asking for stuff
 - ask death to come help you fight, new action
 - Space and e for attack and roll, tooltip
 - Get rid of enters in javascript input box

 - Escape exits typing
 - Save every request and response
 - Don't flip player direction when you walk vertically
 - Perfect dodge roll just after you roll, sound effect
 and particles. Lets you keep momentum. Each dodge roll
 takes slightly different amount of time so you have to
 judge it
