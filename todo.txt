Urgent:
- angel doesn't have characters near you


- Furcate functionality in npc entity into feature flags, streamline creation of entities/things from blender -> game, things. Make rock thing.
- Fix camera angle on forest map, probably introduce custom camera angles per map
- In debugtools show number of arenas allocated, and total megabytes allocated in arenas

- Angel dialog improvements:
    - White sidebars on angel's speech that recede away.
    - Mystical particles that float upwards.
    - Gradient png on the bottom that has more alpha, controlled by same parameter as white sidebars.
    
- Fix everything about the shotgun, test put shotgun away. Make them understand they're holding their shotgun more. REALLY look into characters not being able to shoot eachother
- Cost estimation:
    - On startup if devtools print the estimated cost per generation request of the worst offending character
    - Show in upper right a $ amount for AI costs so far to user
- simple room transition system for angel/real map interop, angel room
- angel character that gives you randomized goals such as (kill so and so) or (befriend blank) or (get john to go to other room), and decides itself with gpt when you're done with the game, when you've 'learned your lesson'.
- can't interact with characters while they're thinking
- fix stencil image being resized in web working
- bubbles collide with eachother so they can't overlap
- camera pans to who is speaking and acting
- E keyboard hints (tutorializing)
- dot dot dot speech bubble to show that they heard your request, but are ignoring you.

Long distance:
- nocodegen instead of codegen argument
- Blur game on bitmap modal input mode
- Detect when an arena accidentally has more than one ArenaTemp requested of it
- In case of AI failure redact the memories that prompted the character to make a generation request
- Polygon and circle collision with cutec2 probably for the player being unable to collide with the camera bounds, and non axis aligned collision rects
- set the game in oregon (suggestion by phillip)
- Room system where characters can go to rooms. camera constrained to room bounds, and know which rooms are near them to go to
- Let ChatGPT file bug reports with something like !BugReport(This shouldn't be happening, developer. I killed them and they're still alive)
- System where I can upload any AI interaction into gpt playground and inspect the conversation
- Incrementally higher resolution system for all textures, configured in a #define. Also flips the images at build time
- Maybe check the hashes of the exported meshes if they all have the same name in the file, to attempt to detect identical geometry data. Same deal with textures in blender, or maybe in the game too actually.
- Stop time when you talk to people
- Much higher move accel, almost instantaneously goes to 
- Imgui Button doesn't move enough when highlighted
- Higher res text instead of text scaling
- Make space and shift also interact
- Design character creator (text input is always a modal, keeps code simple don't have to make a banger line edit)
- Maybe walk by default and shift to run
