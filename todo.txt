Urgent:
- Tag memories from drama as permanent so they're never forgotten and always seed character behavior
- gman character that gives you randomized goals such as (kill so and so) or (befriend blank) or (get john to go to other room), and decides itself with gpt when you're done with the game, when you've 'learned your lesson'.
- room system where characters can go to rooms. camera constrained to room bounds, and know which rooms are near them to go to

Long distance:
- Design character creator
- System where I can upload any AI interaction into gpt playground and inspect the conversation
- Incrementally higher resolution system for all textures, configured in a #define. Also flips the images at build time
